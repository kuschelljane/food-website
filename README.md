# Aladdin Restaurant

A web application that showcases visual ordering for improvements on the existing website and allows the owner to easily review, compare, and provide constructive feedback regarding the design changes. 

## Getting Started

### Installation
* Clone the repository
```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_folder>
```
* Open the application in any web browsers 
```
index.html
```

### Reminders
This project was developed based on the clientâ€™s specific requirements, and responsiveness was not a design priority for this implementation since the focus was on web-based browsers and implementation of animations.
